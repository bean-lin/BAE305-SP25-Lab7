This repository is Ben Lin's Lab 7 repository. 

I think that the value in using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop is that we are able to integrate the different coding locations into one synced workspace. This means that if I am coding in ArduinoIDE, VSCode, or online, I am able to collaborate with other colleagues despite being on a different workstation. It also builds in different versions of the same code sowe are not risking losing the code developed. Overall, integrating Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop into our workflow will be useful in streamlining collaborative work.
